more flexible and allow for a registration period closer to the election date

There is no unified voter register at the state level. Voter registers are compiled at the local level and updated annually. Voter registration is now done automatically for most French citizens when they turn 18. 10 Voters who change their residence, and persons who have not been automatically registered to vote, must actively register with the relevant mairie.

In France, it is the responsibility of citizens to register
and reregister each time they move.4 To register,
one must file an application, submitting a form, an ID,
and proof of address such as a recent utility bill. Most
people register in person at the town hall, although
the application can be brought to the town hall by a
third party, mailed in, or in some cities, completed online.

There is only one exception to this rule: since 1997, teenagers who
turn 18 are, in principle, automatically registered. However, as any
other citizen, they need to reregister when they move away from the
address where they lived at 18.","FRANCE - PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION - 22 April and 6 May 2012 - OSCE/ODIHR NEEDS ASSESSMENT MISSION REPORT; Braconnier, C., Dormagen, J. Y., & Pons, V. (2017).

more than once, making house-to-house enquiry or checking submitted information
against other locally held records.35 However, the legislation does not explicitly oblige
EROs to verify the information they receive. Citizens are obliged to submit their
household forms each year, although EROs may carry forward the entry of nonresponders for another year. Following the conclusion of the canvass, EROs are obliged
to publish updated versions of voters’ lists by 1 December of the canvass year. ' p.10","UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND GENERAL ELECTION - 5 May 2005

'Voter lists are managed locally and there is no central voter registry.14 Electoral Registration Officers
(EROs) are appointed by local authorities and are responsible for compiling and maintaining voter lists

individual electoral registration to replace the system of household registration as a means to increase
accuracy and integrity in voter lists. In most of the UK, migration to individual registration commenced
in 2014 and was completed by the end of 2015.15 This change to the voter registration procedures has
been a focus of the OSCE/ODIHR EET deployed for the 2015 general election. The large majority of
voters were automatically transferred to the new system through a multi-step process of matching voter
information, primarily through the database of the Department of Works and Pensions. The EC
reported that some 770,000 entries were removed after verification. Individuals not automatically
transferred to the new system were required to reapply for inclusion in a voter list. Various outreach
campaigns and the annual canvass by EROs served to target voters who were not automatically
transferred to the new system as well as newly eligible voters.' p.10","UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN
